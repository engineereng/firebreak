A 2D puzzle-platformer made in two weeks for My First Game Jam: Summer 2022, which had the theme "heal".

### Gameplay
The player controls an elf named Asa, who can use her healing powers to heal dead plants temporarily. Plants dead and alive can act as helpful platforms or obstacles. The player needs to strategically plan when to heal plants to reach the end of the level.
